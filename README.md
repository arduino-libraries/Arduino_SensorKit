# Arduino Sensorkit Library

This documentation contains information about the classes and the usage of Arduino_SensorKit library which is primarily used in the [Arduino Sensor Kit](https://store.arduino.cc/sensor-kit-base). This library is a wrapper for other libraries such as

* [U8x8 from u8g2 library](https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_Arduino) Library for monochrome displayes
* [Seeed_Arduino_LIS3DHTR](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_LIS3DHTR) for the 3 Axis Accelerometer
* [Grove_BMP280](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_BMP280) Library for the Barometer
* [DHT-sensor-library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library) for the Temperature and Humidity Sensor

The Arduino_SensorKit Library can be downloaded from the Arduino IDEâ€™s library manager or from the github repository
